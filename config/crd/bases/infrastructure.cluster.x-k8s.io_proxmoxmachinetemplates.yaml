                    description: "ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources
                      must have, which includes all objects users must create. This
                      is a copy of customizable fields from metav1.ObjectMeta. \n
                      ObjectMeta is embedded in `Machine.Spec`, `MachineDeployment.Template`
                      and `MachineSet.Template`, which are not top-level Kubernetes
                      objects. Given that metav1.ObjectMeta has lots of special cases
                      and read-only fields which end up in the generated CRD validation,
                      having it as a subset simplifies the API and some issues that
                      can impact user experience. \n During the [upgrade to controller-tools@v2](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/1054)
                      for v1alpha2, we noticed a failure would occur running Cluster
                      API test suite against the new CRDs, specifically `spec.metadata.creationTimestamp
                      in body must be of type string: \"null\"`. The investigation
                      showed that `controller-tools@v2` behaves differently than its
                      previous version when handling types from [metav1](k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1)
                      package. \n In more details, we found that embedded (non-top
                      level) types that embedded `metav1.ObjectMeta` had validation
                      properties, including for `creationTimestamp` (metav1.Time).
                      The `metav1.Time` type specifies a custom json marshaller that,
                      when IsZero() is true, returns `null` which breaks validation
                      because the field isn't marked as nullable. \n In future versions,
                      controller-tools@v2 might allow overriding the type and validation
                      for embedded types. When that happens, this hack should be revisited."
